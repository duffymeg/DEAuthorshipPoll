# DEAuthorshipPoll
Code and data associated with literature survey & poll regarding last and corresponding authorship practices in ecology.

The .r file was used as a sort of scratch pad where I tried out different analyses. The .rmd file has the code for the analyses and figures that appear in the final publication (Duffy 2017, Ecology & Evolution).

Poll was here: https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2016/04/06/poll-what-are-your-views-on-last-and-corresponding-authorship-in-ecology/
